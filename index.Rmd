## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), specifically which ETFs perform best in certain market conditions. I have been an active ETF investor for a few years and have seen their returns fluctuate as a result of broader macroeconomic trends. I want to research the relationships between market conditions and ETF performances to better inform my future investment decisions.
